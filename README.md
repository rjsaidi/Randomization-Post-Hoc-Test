# Randomization-Post-Hoc-Test
This code creates a function for a dataset such that the input "treatment" a long-format categorical variable and the input "outcome" is a long-format quantitative variable. It should be used as a post hoc test to a non-parametric analysis of variance or an alternative to the two-sample t-test.
